<H2>뚱이 the monk parakeet이란 무엇인가?</H2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_parakeet" target="_blank"><strong>The monk parakeet <u>(Myiopsitta monachus)</u></strong></a>, also known as the Quaker parrot,is a species of true parrot in the family Psittacidae.
<p style="margin-top:40px;">It is a small, bright-green parrot with a greyish breast  and greenish-yellow abdomen. Its average lifespan is 20–30 years.</p><br>
It originates from the temperate to subtropical areas of South America. Self-sustaining feral populations occur in many places, 
mainly in areas of similar climate in North America and Europe.
<p>The monk parakeet was described by French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, 
    in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux.[2] The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by
     François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle,</p> <p>which was produced under the supervision of 
        Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text.</p></body></html>
